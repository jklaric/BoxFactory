Compulsory assignment front and back end app for EASV

Good day Alex!

I have some information about the project I would like you to know about.

My group has been through a lot of problems so I will list them here so that you are not confused by everything.

-My group includes Abdul, James and me. Abdul is not listed as a contributor for some reason but you can see his commits.

-Thanks to a lot of issues like: sickness, remote work, changing of group members during the development process and inexperience among other things,
the workflow does not work in the latest version for some reason and we have not had enough time towards the end to fix it.

-The tests work but they have been written wrong from the start so to run them you need to run the actual backend in one window and the tests in the other.
This is also a product of our previous problems.

-The application works though, and includes all functions required, minus the pipeline.

-The connection string of the database has not been provided anywhere so feel free to contact me if you would still like to test the app.

-We are all aware that it is a mess and would like to ask for an extension of the deadline if the project does not meet the requirements in this state.

Sorry for the inconvenience, and we hope to get another shot at this since our group has managed to pull together towards the end to have a working application,
even though time was not on our side at this point.

Have a nice day!
